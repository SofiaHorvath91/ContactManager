        A fandom is a subculture composed of fans characterized by a feeling of empathy and camaraderie with others
        who share a common interest. Fans typically are interested in even minor details of the objects of their fandom
        and spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, often as a part of a social network
        with particular practices, differentiating fandom-affiliated people from those with only a casual interest.
        <br />
        A fandom can grow around any area of human interest or activity, and many fandoms overlap. 
        There are a number of large conventions that cater to fandom such as film, comics, anime, television shows, cosplay, 
        and the opportunity to buy and sell related merchandise. 
        Annual conventions such as Comic Con International, Wondercon, Dragon Con and New York Comic Con are some of the 
        more well known and highly attended events that cater to overlapping fandoms.
